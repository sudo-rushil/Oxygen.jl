# Oxygen.jl Documentation

Oxygen.jl is a package for cheminformatics. It is focused on providing efficient support for chemical structure analysis and deep learning over molecules, as well as general purpose chemical data manipulation in Julia.

Keep in mind Oxygen.jl is under early stages of active development. Features are expected to change frequently.

## Introduction

This website serves as documentation for the Oxygen.jl package. The sections of the documentation are accessible on the left hand sidebar.

If you want documentation for a particular function, please browse the API or use the search functionality.

## Installing

Currently, Oxygen.jl only offers limited functionality. If you want to install it, use Julia's package manager. Type `Pkg.clone("https://github.com/sudo-rushil/Oxygen.jl.git")` at the Julia `REPL`. Then, it can be used like any other Julia package.

```julia
using Oxygen
```
